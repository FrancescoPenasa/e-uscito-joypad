Joined at the waist, you and your partner share a long, wriggling body as you wrestle your opponents for control of the ball. Since you're sharing the same body, you'll need to carefully communicate (or just shout a lot). With every action affecting both you and your partner, PMPY combines the best parts of co-op multiplayer with the worst parts of your last breakup.  <br/><br/><ul><li>Frantic local multiplayer gameplay in the vein of Sportsfriends or Towerfall.  <br/></li><li>Compete in multiple game types that will test your friendship in different ways, or play around in a sandbox area filled with toys and secrets.  <br/></li><li>Low on controllers? Share a controller with a friend or try controlling two heads simultaneously - a two-player game can be played with just one controller!   <br/></li><li>Accessible yet deep - play it as a noisy party game or hold a fiercely competitive grudge match. </li></ul>",

It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026 And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. \r\n\r\nKratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \r\n\r\nFrom the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise. \r\n\r\nWith an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre",
                    "descrizione_html": "<p>It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. </p>\n<p>His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026 And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. </p>\n<p>Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. </p>\n<p>From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise. </p>\n<p>With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre</p>",

First, doctors learn from his memory his past to find out why before his death he wants to fulfil such a strange desire - to go to the Moon.<br />\nThen there is a strong story about meetings and partings, about promises and losses. It ends well, but only in the patient&#39;s memories.<br />\nThe gameplay consists of the study of small locations, the solution of simple puzzles and long, saturated dialogues. All this becomes fascinating thanks to the elaborated plot.</p>",

Layla Hassan relieves the memories of two ancient Egyptians named Bayek and Aya who create the Assassins order.\r\n\r\nLevels are open-ended which allows both stealth or open combat approaches. Players are put in an open world in which they can complete quests in order to either progress through the story, level their character up or upgrade their equipment. The \"eagle vision\" mode was replaced by an eagle by the name of Senu. Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.\r\n\r\nThe game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them.",

His goal is to avenge the death of his father. Hazuki follows the murderer, Lan Di, to the mountainous region in China called Guilin.

While the game is set outside Japan, Hazuki can stay in touch with his friends back home by calling them on the phone.\r\n\r\n###Development\r\nThe game spent more than ten years in development due to high costs of the original two games (the first Shenmue was the most expensive game ever at the time of its release).

The game consists 17 levels (named as \u201ckingdoms\u201d). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges.

Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario\u2019s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them.

            "descrizione_txt": "Tricky Towers is a tower-building puzzle game developed by WeirdBeard.\n\nIn Tricky Towers, the players have to stack the falling blocks of a building into one tower. The game bears some resemblance to Tetris with the difference being the objective to stack the blocks instead of clearing rows of them. The rows do not disappear. The game is physics-based, so the player can't win by just dropping the blocks in a random manner. Several in-game events are present, for example, the blocks may drop faster or become slippery. Sometimes the blocks even double in size. You play as a wizard that competes against other wizards and has to build his tower as tall and stable as possible. \n\nIt is possible to cast spells that either assist the players or make the building harder for other wizzards. The players can use 17 spells Throughout a match. Light magic spells are used for making the gameplay easier for the player while Dark magic spells make it harder for your opponents to progress. \n\nThree game modes are present: Race, Puzzle, and Survival. A handful of single-player challenges is also available where the player has to meet certain game conditions to succeed.",
