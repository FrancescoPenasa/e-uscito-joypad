The gameplay consists of choosing the dialogue options, reacting to QTE button-mash and watching cutscenes. \r\nThe critics are marking down that unlike many other TellTale games 'The Wolf Among Us' borrows original comic book's portrayal thus looking better, and having the original as sequel before you eyes lets you engage with Fabula more quickly.",

The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy\u2019s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as \u201ckingdoms\u201d). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario\u2019s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.",
